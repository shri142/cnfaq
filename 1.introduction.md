# 1. What is Computer Network  ?

Computer Network is collection of computers connected together for exchanging information.

# 2. Why we need computer network  ?

Computer network help the user to share the resources and in communication. It useful for file sharing , communication ,application sharing , lan gaming and many more.

# 3. What are types of the computer network ? Explain each type.

Generally, networks are distinguished based on their geographical span. A network can be as small as distance between your mobile phone and its Bluetooth headphone and as large as the internet itself, covering the whole geographical world.

### i. Personal Area Network
			A Personal Area Network (PAN) is smallest network which is very personal to a user. This may include Bluetooth enabled devices or infra-red enabled devices. PAN has connectivity range up to 10 meters. PAN may include wireless computer keyboard and mouse, Bluetooth enabled headphones, wireless printers, and TV remotes.
			For example, Piconet is Bluetooth-enabled Personal Area Network which may contain up to 8 devices connected together in a master-slave fashion.

### ii. Local Area Network
			A computer network spanned inside a building and operated under single administrative system is generally termed as Local Area Network (LAN). Usually, LAN covers an organization offices, schools, colleges or universities. Number of systems connected in LAN may vary from as least as two to as much as 16 million.
			LAN provides a useful way of sharing the resources between end users. The resources such as printers, file servers, scanners, and internet are easily sharable among	computers. LANs are composed of inexpensive networking and routing equipment. It may contains local servers serving file storage and other locally shared applications. It mostly operates on private IP addresses and does not involve heavy routing. LAN
			works under its own local domain and controlled centrally.

    		LAN uses either Ethernet or Token-ring technology. Ethernet is most widely employed
    		LAN technology and uses Star topology, while Token-ring is rarely seen.
    		LAN can be wired, wireless, or in both forms at once.
    	iii.Metropolitan Area Network
    		The Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) generally expands throughout a city such as
    		cable TV network. It can be in the form of Ethernet, Token-ring, ATM, or Fiber
    		Distributed Data Interface (FDDI).
    		Metro Ethernet is a service which is provided by ISPs. This service enables its users
    		to expand their Local Area Networks. For example, MAN can help an organization to
    		connect all of its offices in a city.
    		Backbone of MAN is high-capacity and high-speed fiber optics. MAN works in between
    		Local Area Network and Wide Area Network. MAN provides uplink for LANs to WANs
    		or internet.
    	iv. Wide Area Network
    		As the name suggests, the Wide Area Network (WAN) covers a wide area which may
    		span across provinces and even a whole country. Generally, telecommunication
    		networks are Wide Area Network. These networks provide connectivity to MANs and
    		LANs. Since they are equipped with very high speed backbone, WANs use very
    		expensive network equipment.
    		WAN may use advanced technologies such as Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM),
    		Frame Relay, and Synchronous Optical Network (SONET). WAN may be managed by
    		multiple administration.

### 4.  What are the types of data flows in computer ?
     Simplex :- Communication is unidirectional
     Half Duplex :- Each station can both transmit and receive, but not at the same time
     Full Duplex :- Both stations can transmit and receive simultaneously


# 5.  What are the various network topologies ? Explain them.

Ans. A Network Topology is the arrangement with which computer systems or network
		devices are connected to each other. Topologies may define both physical and logical
		aspect of the network. Both logical and physical topologies could be same or different
		in a same network.

    	i. Point-to-Point
    		Point-to-point networks contains exactly two hosts such as computer, switches,
    		routers, or servers connected back to back using a single piece of cable. Often, the
    		receiving end of one host is connected to sending end of the other and vice versa.
    		If the hosts are connected point-to-point logically, then may have multiple
    		intermediate devices. But the end hosts are unaware of underlying network and see
    		each other as if they are connected directly.
    	ii. Bus Topology
    		In case of Bus topology, all devices share single communication line or cable. Bus
    		topology may have problem while multiple hosts sending data at the same time.
    		Therefore, Bus topology either uses CSMA/CD technology or recognizes one host as
    		Bus Master to solve the issue. It is one of the simple forms of networking where a
    		failure of a device does not affect the other devices. But failure of the shared
    		communication line can make all other devices stop functioning.
    		Both ends of the shared channel have line terminator. The data is sent in only one
    		direction and as soon as it reaches the extreme end, the terminator removes the data
    		from the line.
    	iii. Star Topology
    		All hosts in Star topology are connected to a central device, known as hub device,
    		using a point-to-point connection. That is, there exists a point to point connection
    		between hosts and hub. The hub device can be any of the following:
    			a. Layer-1 device such as hub or repeater
    			b. Layer-2 device such as switch or bridge
    			c. Layer-3 device such as router or gateway
    		As in Bus topology, hub acts as single point of failure. If hub fails, connectivity of all
    		hosts to all other hosts fails. Every communication between hosts takes place through
    		only the hub. Star topology is not expensive as to connect one more host, only one
    		cable is required and configuration is simple.
    	iv. Ring Topology
    		In ring topology, each host machine connects to exactly two other machines, creating
    		a circular network structure. When one host tries to communicate or send message
    		to a host which is not adjacent to it, the data travels through all intermediate hosts.
    		To connect one more host in the existing structure, the administrator may need only
    		one more extra cable.
    		Failure of any host results in failure of the whole ring. Thus, every connection in the
    		ring is a point of failure. There are methods which employ one more backup ring.
    	v. Mesh Topology
    		In this type of topology, a host is connected to one or multiple hosts. This topology
    		has hosts in point-to-point connection with every other host or may also have hosts
    		which are in point-to-point connection with few hosts only
    		Hosts in Mesh topology also work as relay for other hosts which do not have direct
    		point-to-point links. Mesh technology comes into two types:
    			a. Full Mesh: All hosts have a point-to-point connection to every other host in
    			  the network. Thus for every new host n(n-1)/2 connections are required. It
    			  provides the most reliable network structure among all network topologies.
    			b. Partially Mesh: Not all hosts have point-to-point connection to every other
    			  host. Hosts connect to each other in some arbitrarily fashion. This topology
    			  exists where we need to provide reliability to some hosts out of all.
    	vi. Tree Topology
    		Also known as Hierarchical Topology, this is the most common form of network
    		topology in use presently. This topology imitates as extended Star topology and
    		inherits properties of Bus topology.
    		This topology divides the network into multiple levels/layers of network. Mainly in
    		LANs, a network is bifurcated into three types of network devices. The lowermost is
    		access-layer where computers are attached. The middle layer is known as distribution
    		layer, which works as mediator between upper layer and lower layer. The highest
    		layer is known as core layer, and is central point of the network, i.e. root of the tree
    		from which all nodes fork.
    		All neighboring hosts have point-to-point connection between them. Similar to the
    		Bus topology, if the root goes down, then the entire network suffers even though it
    		is not the single point of failure. Every connection serves as point of failure, failing of
    		which divides the network into unreachable segment.
    	vii. Daisy Chain
    		This topology connects all the hosts in a linear fashion. Similar to Ring topology, all
    		hosts are connected to two hosts only, except the end hosts. Means, if the end hosts
    		in daisy chain are connected then it represents Ring topology.
    		Each link in daisy chain topology represents single point of failure. Every link failure
    		splits the network into two segments. Every intermediate host works as relay for its
    		immediate hosts.
    	viii. Hybrid Topology
    		A network structure whose design contains more than one topology is said to be
    		hybrid topology. Hybrid topology inherits merits and demerits of all the incorporating
    		topologies.
    		The above picture represents an arbitrarily hybrid topology. The combining topologies
    		may contain attributes of Star, Ring, Bus, and Daisy-chain topologies. Most WANs
    		are connected by means of Dual-Ring topology and networks connected to them are
    		mostly Star topology networks. Internet is the best example of largest Hybrid
    		topology.

   BUS TOPOLOGY: The most widely used of these is bus, because it is employed by Ethernet, which is the dominant LAN architecture. In a bus topology all devices are connected to a central cable, called the bus or backbone. This topology is relatively inexpensive and easy to install for small networks.

	 RING TOPOLOGY:In a ring topology each device is connected directly to two other devices, one on either side of it, to form a closed loop. This topology is relatively expensive and difficult to install, but it offers high bandwidth and can span large distances. A variation is the token ring, in which signals travel in only one direction around the loop, carried by a so-called token from node to node.

	 STAR TOPOLOGY:In a star topology all devices are connected directly to a central computer or server. Such networks are relatively easy to install and manage, but bottlenecks can occur because all data must pass through the central device.

	 MESH TOPOLOGY:The mesh topology can be either a full mesh or a partial mesh. In the former, each computer is connected directly to each of the others. In the latter, some computers are connected to most of the others, and some are connected only to those other nodes with which they exchange the most data.

# 6. What are the various network topologies ?

The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP)
to link devices worldwide. It is a network of networks that consists of private, public, academic, business,
and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless,
and optical networking technologies.

    => Internet is a global computer network providing a variety of information and communication facilities, consisting of interconnected networks using standardized communication protocols.
    => The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and peer-to-peer networks for file sharing.

8.  Compare internet and world wide web. Also explain What is internetwork ?
    Internet is the not a single network but a network of networks and the web is a distributed system that runs on top of the internet.
    A collection of interconnected networks is internet. Also known as a network of networks.


    A collection of interconnected networks is internet. Also known as a network of networks.

    The internet is an informal term for the world-wide communication network of computers. It sends information quickly
    between computers around the world. It has millions of smaller domestic, academic, business, and government networks, which
    together carry many different kinds of information.
    The World Wide Web is one of its biggest services. It is used by a few billion people all over the world.

 Internetwork
		A network of networks is called an internetwork, or simply the internet. It is the
		largest network in existence on this planet. The internet hugely connects all WANs
		and it can have connection to LANs and Home networks. Internet uses TCP/IP
		protocol suite and uses IP as its addressing protocol. Present day, Internet is widely
		implemented using IPv4. Because of shortage of address spaces, it is gradually
		migrating from IPv4 to IPv6.
		Internet enables its users to share and access enormous amount of information
		worldwide. It uses WWW, FTP, email services, audio, and video streaming etc. At
		huge level, internet works on Client-Server model.
		Internet uses very high speed backbone of fiber optics. To inter-connect various
		continents, fibers are laid under sea known to us as submarine communication cable.
		Internet is widely deployed on World Wide Web services using HTML linked pages
		and is accessible by client software known as Web Browsers. When a user requests
		a page using some web browser located on some Web Server anywhere in the world,
		the Web Server responds with the proper HTML page. The communication delay is
		very low.
		Internet is serving many proposes and is involved in many aspects of life. Some of
		them are:
		a. Web sites
		b. E-mail
		c. Instant Messaging
		d. Blogging
		e. Social Media
		f. Marketing
		g. Networking
		h. Resource Sharing
		i. Audio and Video Streaming

# 12. What is a node?
    Ans.    A node refers to a point or joint where a connection takes place.
            It can be computer or device that is part of a network.
            Two or more nodes are needed in order to form a network connection.

# 13. What are routers?
    Ans.    Routers can connect two or more network segments. These are intelligent network devices that store information
            in its routing table such as paths, hops and bottlenecks.
            With this info, they are able to determine the best path for data transfer. Routers operate at the OSI Network Layer.


# 14. Name the types of reference models.
    a)OSI Reference model (Open Systems interconnection).
    b)TCP/IP Reference model.


# 15. What is Packet switched networking?
    This technology involves breaking down the data into packets that would be transferred from one computer to the other
    until the final destination computer was reached. Also, if any data were lost, it would be resent.

# 16. What is broadcasting?
    Broadcast systems generally allow the possibility of addressing a packet to all destinations by using a special code
    in the address field. When a packet with this code is transmitted, it is received and processed by every machine on the
    network. This mode of operation is called as broadcasting.

# 17. Internet Vs WWW
    Internet is an infrastructure that makes the WWW work. WWW is just one of many "Virtual networks" built on internet. i.e., WWW is
    a medium through which we can access internet.

# 18. What are the key elements of a protocol?
    a). Syntax: Structure or format of data. i.e., the order in which the data is presented or interpreted.
    b). Semantics: It refers to the "meaning" of each section of bits.
    Syntax helps us to recognize the bit and semantics helps us to take action.
    c). Timing: Refers to 2 characteristics- When the data should be sent and how fast they can be sent.

# 19. What are the design issues for the layers?
    a). Addressing
    b). Data transfer
    c). Error control
    d). Sequencing
    e). Flow Control
    f). Segmentation

# 20. Function of OSI Model?

    Layer 7: The application layer. This is the layer at which communication partners are identified (Is there someone
        to talk to?), network capacity is assessed (Will the network let me talk to them right now?), and that creates a
        thing to send or opens the thing received.  (This layer is not the application itself, it is the set of services
        an application should be able to make use of directly, although some applications may perform application layer
        functions.)

    Layer 6: The presentation layer. This layer is usually part of an operating system (OS) and converts incoming and
        outgoing data from one presentation format to another (for example, from clear text to encrypted text at one
        end and back to clear text at the other).

    Layer 5: The session layer. This layer sets up, coordinates and terminates conversations. Services include
        authentication and reconnection after an interruption. On the Internet, Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and
        User Datagram Protocol (UDP) provide these services for most applications.

    Layer 4: The transport layer. This layer manages packetization of data, then the delivery of the packets, including
        checking for errors in the data once it arrives. On the Internet, TCP and UDP provide these services for most
        applications as well.

    Layer 3: The network layer. This layer handles the addressing and routing of the data (sending it in the right direction
        to the right destination on outgoing transmissions and receiving incoming transmissions at the packet level). IP is the
        network layer for the Internet.

    Layer 2: The data-link layer. This layer sets up links across the physical network, putting packets into network frames.
        This layer has two sub-layers, the Logical Link Control Layer and the Media Access Control Layer. Ethernet is the main
        data link layer in use.

    Layer 1: The physical layer. This layer conveys the bit stream through the network at the electrical, optical or
        radio level. It provides the hardware means of sending and receiving data on a carrier networ

    Ans.	Computer networks are classified based on various factors. They include:
    			i.Geographical span
    			ii.Inter-connectivity
    			iii.Administration
    			iv.Architecture

# 26. What is Geographical Span in Computer Networks?
    Ans.	Geographically a network can be seen in one of the following categories:
    			i. It may be spanned across your table, among Bluetooth enabled devices,ranging not more than few meters.
    			ii. It may be spanned across a whole building, including intermediate devices to connect all floors.
    			iii. It may be spanned across a whole city.
    			iv. It may be spanned across multiple cities or provinces.
    			v. It may be one network covering whole world.

# 27. What is Inter-Connectivity in Computer Networks?
    Ans. Components of a network can be connected to each other differently in some fashion.
    	 By connectedness we mean either logically, physically, or both ways.
    		i. Every single device can be connected to every other device on network, making the network mesh.
    		ii. All devices can be connected to a single medium but geographically disconnected, created bus-like structure.
    		iii. Each device is connected to its left and right peers only, creating linear structure.
    		iv. All devices connected together with a single device, creating star-like structure.
    		v. All devices connected arbitrarily using all previous ways to connect each other, resulting in a hybrid structure.

# 28. What is Administration in Computer Networks?
    Ans. From an administrator’s point of view, a network can be private network which belongs a single autonomous system and
    		cannot be accessed outside its physical or logical domain. A network can be public, which is accessed by all.

# 29. What is Network Architecture in Computer Networks?
    Ans. Computer networks can be discriminated into various types such as Client-Server,peer-to-peer or hybrid, depending upon its architecture.
    		i. There can be one or more systems acting as Server. Other being Client, requests the Server to serve requests.
    		Server takes and processes request on behalf of Clients.
    		ii. Two systems can be connected Point-to-Point, or in back-to-back fashion. They both reside at the same level and called peers.
    		iii. There can be hybrid network which involves network architecture of both the above types.

# 30. What is Network Applications in Computer Networks?
    Ans. Computer systems and peripherals are connected to form a network. They provide numerous advantages:
    		i. Resource sharing such as printers and storage devices
    		ii. Exchange of information by means of e-Mails and FTP
    		iii. Information sharing by using Web or Internet
    		iv. Interaction with other users using dynamic web pages
    		v. IP phones
    		vi. Video conferences
    		vii. Parallel computing
    		viii. Instant messaging

# 31. What is Ethernet?
    Ans. Ethernet
    		Ethernet is a widely deployed LAN technology. This technology was invented by Bob
    		Metcalfe and D.R. Boggs in the year 1970. It was standardized in IEEE 802.3 in 1980.
    		Ethernet shares media. Network which uses shared media has high probability of
    		data collision. Ethernet uses Carrier Sense Multi Access/Collision Detection
    		(CSMA/CD) technology to detect collisions. On the occurrence of collision in Ethernet,
    		all its hosts roll back, wait for some random amount of time, and then re-transmit
    		the data.
    		Ethernet connector is network interface card equipped with 48-bits MAC address. This
    		helps other Ethernet devices to identify and communicate with remote devices in
    		Ethernet.
    		Traditional Ethernet uses 10BASE-T specifications. The number 10 depicts 10MBPS
    		speed, BASE stands for baseband, and T stands for Thick Ethernet. 10BASE-T
    		Ethernet provides transmission speed up to 10MBPS and uses coaxial cable or Cat-5
    		twisted pair cable with RJ-5 connector. Ethernet follows Star topology with segment
    		length up to 100 meters. All devices are connected to a hub/switch in a star fashion.

# 32. What is meant by RIP?

\->RIP short for Routing Information Protocol is used by routers to send data from one network to another.
  It efficiently manages routing data by broadcasting its routing table to all other routers within the network.

# 33. What does 10Base-T mean?

\->The 10 refers to the data transfer rate, in this case is 10Mbps. The word Base refers to base band, as oppose to broad band. T means twisted pair, which is the cable used for that network.

# 34. What are MAC addresses?

MAC, or Media Access Control, uniquely identifies a device on the network. It is also known as physical address or Ethernet address.

A MAC address is made up of 6-byte parts

# 35. What are protocols?
    Protocol is a standard used to define a method of exchanging data over a computer network.
    For example : TCP, IP, UDP, POP, SMTP, HTTP, and FTP

# 36.What are connection oriented and connectionless services?
   Layers can offer two different types of service to the layers above them: connection-
   oriented and connectionless.
   1)Connection-oriented service is modeled after the telephone system. To talk
   to someone, you pick up the phone, dial the number, talk, and then hang up. Similarly,
   to use a connection-oriented network service, the service user first establishes
   a connection, uses the connection, and then releases the connection.
   2)In contrast to connection-oriented service, connectionless service is modeled
   after the postal system. Normally, when two messages are sent to
   the same destination, the first one sent will be the first one to arrive. However, it
   is possible that the first one sent can be delayed so that the second one arrives
   first.

# 37.Name the factors that affect the performance of the network?
    a. Number of Users
    b. Type of transmission medium
    c. Hardware
    d. Software

# 38. Name the factors that affect the reliability of the network?
    a. Frequency of failure
    b. Recovery time of a network after a failure

# 39 .Mention different categories of computer networks (on the basis of scale) and distinguish
    one from the other.
Ans:   Local Area Network (LAN): It is privately owned communication systems that cover a small
       area, say a building or a complex of buildings. Length is about 10 meters to few kilometers and
       operates at a high speed like 10 MBPS to 1000 MBPS. It has very low error rate.

        Metropolitan Area Network (MAN): It is public or privately owned communication system that
        typically covers a complete city. Speed is about 10 MBPS and follows DQDB (Distributed Queue
        Double Bus) standard. Its reliability is moderate.

        Wide Area Network (WAN): It covers a large geographical area and usually owned by a state. Data
        transfer rate is low (few KBPS to 10 MBPS) and error rate is much higher.

# 40. What are the two types of Transmission technologies, basis on which computer networks
    can be categorized?

Ans:    Broadly there are two types of transmission technology:
        1\. Broadcast networks: a single communication channel that is shared by all the machines on the
        network

        2. Point-to-point networks: This network consists of many connections between individual pairs of
        machines. To go from the source to destination a message (or packet) may have to visit one or more
        intermediate machines

# 41. What is the use of a default gateway?
    Default gateways provide means for the local networks to connect to the external network.
    The default gateway for connecting to the external network is usually the address of the external router port.

# 42. What is RIP?

    RIP, short for Routing Information Protocol is used by routers to send data from one network to another.
    It efficiently manages routing data by broadcasting its routing table to all other routers within the network.
    It determines the network distance in units of hops.

# 42.What is Network Topology?
Ans.   A Network Topology is the pattern in which nodes(i.e. computers,routers etc..devices) are connected to a local area network(LAN) or other network via links(e.g. optical fibre,copper wire cabel etc...).

# 43.What is Hybrid Network Topology?
Ans.A hybrid topology is a type of network topology that uses two or more other network topologies, including bus topology, mesh topology, ring topology, star topology, and tree topology.

Ans. A tree topology combines characteristics of linear bus and star topologies. It consists of groups of star-configured workstations connected to a linear bus backbone cable
# 44.What is Tree Topology?

# 45.What is Star topology?
Ans.In Star topology, all the components of network are connected to the central device called “hub” which may be a hub, a router or a switch. Unlike Bus topology (discussed earlier), where nodes were connected to central cable, here all the workstations are connected to central device with a point-to-point connection. So it can be said that every computer is indirectly connected to every other node by the help of “hub”.

# 46.What is point to point topology?
  It provides a dedicated link between two devices.
  The entire capacity of the link is reserved for transmission between the two devices.

# 47. Importance of networking in modern world with a real life example?
    Ans. Uber uses networking to track the taxi which is near the customer which helps the taxi to reach the customer early and also helps the customer to track the taxi and taxi drivers and helps reducing crime


# 48. What are protocols?
    Protocol is a standard used to define a method of exchanging data over a computer network.
    For example : TCP, IP, UDP, POP, SMTP, HTTP, and FTP


# 49. Expand the acronym MAC.
    Ans. Media Access Control

# 50. Expand the acronym LAN.
    Ans. Local Area Network


# 51. What does 10Base-T mean?
    \->The 10 refers to the data transfer rate, in this case is 10Mbps. The word Base refers to base band, as oppose to broad band. T means twisted pair, which is the cable used for that network.

    Ans. Wide Area Network
		# 52. Expand the acronym WAN.


# 53. What is meant by RIP?
    \->RIP short for Routing Information Protocol is used by routers to send data from one network to another.
      It efficiently manages routing data by broadcasting its routing table to all other routers within the network.

# 54. What is a topology?
     Topology of a network is defined as the geometric representation of the relationship
     of all the links and linking devices (node) to one another .

    55.What is mesh network?
     A network in which there are multiple network links between computers to provide
     multiple paths for data to travel.

# 55. What are major types of networks?
    Server-based network
    Peer-to-peer network

# 56. What is URL ?
    It is a standard for specifying any kind of information on the World Wide Web.

# 57. What is Hypertext Transfer Protocol(HTTP) ?
    It is the main protocol used to access data on the World Wide Web .
    the protol transfers data in the form of plain text,hypertext,audio,video,and so on.

# 58. Expand the acronym NIC.
    Network Interface Card


# 60. What are the key design issues of a computer Network?
    Ans
    a. Connectivity
    b. Cost-effective Resource Sharing
    c. Support for common Services
    d. Performance
