28. What is routing?What are the types of routing?

Routing is the process of selecting a path for traffic in a network, or between or across multiple networks.
Routing is performed for many types of networks, including circuit-switched networks,
such as the public switched telephone network (PSTN) and computer networks, such as the Internet.
The types of routing are:-
1)Flooding
2)Distance vector routing
3)Link State Routing
4)Hierarchical Routing
5)Broadcast routing
6)Multicast routing
7)Anycast routing


29. Which one of the following routing algorithm can be used for network layer design?
shortest path algorithm,distance vector routing,link state routing

30. The network layer protocol of internet is
internet protocol

31. ICMP is primarily used for
error and diagnostic functions


32. The 4 byte IP address consists of?
network address and host address

33. In virtual circuit network each packet contains?
  A short VC number


34. Which device works at network layer?
     Router

35.How many routing protocols are present in Network layer?

36. Properties of network ?

The network layer is responsible for routing which entails learning the paths, selecting the best path and forwarding the packet.
Because it services multiple layer 4 protocols it multiplexes.

37. A subset of a network that includes all the routers but contains no loops is called........?
     spanning tree

38. What is fragmentation?
Ans:Fragmentation is when a datagram has to be broken up into smaller datagrams to fit the frame
size of a certain network. Different networks have different MTUs (maximum transfer unit), when a
datagram enters a network with a smaller MTU the gateway/router needs to fragment this packet
into smaller packets that fit the new MTU.

39. What is tunneling in network layer?
Ans:Tunneling is a protocol that allows for the secure movement of data from one network to another. Tunneling involves allowing private
network communications to be sent across a public network, such as the Internet, through a process called encapsulation. The encapsulation
process allows for data packets to appear as though they are of a public nature to a public network when they are actually private data
packets, allowing them to pass through unnoticed.Tunneling is also known as port forwarding.

40. What is Store-and-Forward Packet Switching?
Ans:All routers are part of subnet and run same algorithms.A host with a packet to send transmits it to the nearest
router.The packet is stored there until it has fully arrived so the checksum can be verified.
Then it is forwarded to the next router along the path until it reaches the destination host, where it is delivered.
This mechanism is store-and-forward packet switching.

41. Routing Algorithms?
Ans:The Optimality Principle
    Shortest Path Routing
    Flooding
    Distance Vector Routing
    Link State Routing
    Hierarchical Routing

Ans:Correctness
    Simplicity
    Robustness
    Stability
    Fairness, and
    Optimality
    Dynamic to changes

43. Nonadaptive and Adaptive roting algo?
Ans:Nonadaptive algorithms do not base their routing decisions on measurements or estimates of the current traffic and topology.
    Instead,it is computed in advance, off-line, and downloaded to the routers when the network is booted.
    This procedure is sometimes called static routing.

    Adaptive algorithms  change their routing decisions to reflect changes in the topology,  and usually the traffic as well.
    Adaptive algorithms differ in where they get their information.
    (e.g., locally, from adjacent routers, or from all routers)

44. What is link state routing?
Ans:Each router must do the following:
    a.Discover its neighbors, learn their network address.
    b.Measure the delay or cost to each of its neighbors.
    c.Construct a packet telling all it has just learned.
    d.Send this packet to all other routers.
    e.Compute the shortest path to every other router.

45. Congestion Control Algorithma?

    Congestion Prevention Policies
    Congestion Control in Virtual-Circuit Subnets
    Congestion Control in Datagram Subnets

    Jitter Control

46. General principles of Congestion control Mechanism?
Ans:1.Monitor the system .
      -detect when and where congestion occurs.
    2.Pass information to where action can be taken.
    3.Adjust system operation to correct the problem.


47. Explain Connection oriented and connectionless services?

Connection-oriented :
  Requires a session connection be established before any data can be sent.
  This method is often called a "reliable" network service. It can guarantee
  that data will arrive in the same order. Connection-oriented services set up
  virtual links between end systems through a network

Connectionless  :
  Does not require a session connection between sender and receiver.
  The sender simply starts sending packets (called datagrams) to the destination.
  This service does not have the reliability of the connection-oriented method,
  but it is useful for periodic burst transfers. Neither system must maintain
  state information for the systems that they send transmission to or receive transmission from.
  A connectionless network provides minimal services.

48.What is Firewall?

  A firewall is a system designed to prevent unauthorized access to or from a private network.
  You can implement a firewall in either hardware or software form, or a combination of both.
  Firewalls prevent unauthorized Internet users from accessing private networks connected to the Internet,
  especially intranets. All messages entering or leaving the intranet (i.e., the local network to which you are connected)
  must pass through the firewall, which examines each message and blocks those that do not meet the specified security criteria.

 49.What is Fragmentation?

 7.What is the difference between routing and forwarding?
->Forwarding  is  about  moving  a  packet  from  a  router’s  input  link  to  the
appropriate output link. Routing is about determiningthe end to routes between sources  and destination.

50. What are routers?
->Routers can connect two or more network segments. These are intelligent network devices that store information in its
routing table such as paths, hops and bottlenecks. With this info, they are able to determine the best path for data transfer.
Routers operate at the OSI Network Layer.

51. What is subnet mask?
-> A subnet mask is combined with an IP address in order to identify two parts: the extended network address and the host
address. Like an IP address, a subnet mask is made up of 32 bits.

52) What is the maximum length allowed for a UTP cable?
-> A single segment of UTP cable has an allowable length of 90 to 100 meters. This limitation can be overcome by using
repeaters and switches.

53)What are MAC addresses?
-> MAC, or Media Access Control, uniquely identifies a device on the network.It is also known as physical address or
Ethernet address. A MAC address is made up of 6-byte parts.

54) What are gateways?
-> Gateways provide connectivity between two or more network segments. It is usually a computer that runs the gateway software and provides translation services.
This translation is a key in allowing different systems to communicate on the network.

55. Header of datagram in IPv4 has
->20 to 60 bytes

56. What are the Network layer functionalities?

    various tasks aimed to achieve a single goal. These can be:
        i. Addressing devices and networks.
        ii. Populating routing tables or static routes.
        iii. Queuing incoming and outgoing data and then forwarding them according to
             quality of service constraints set for those packets.
        iv. Internetworking between two different subnets.

        i. Quality of service management
        ii. Load balancing and link management
        iii. Security
        iv. Interrelation of different protocols and subnets with different schema.
        v. Different logical network design over the physical network design.
        vi. L3 VPN and tunnels can be used to provide end to end dedicated connectivity.

58. Explain Different types of switching in Network Layer.
Ans. Switching Via Memory
        First generation routers:
        i. traditional computers with switching under direct
            control of CPU
        ii.packet copied to system’s memory
        iii. speed limited by memory bandwidth (2 bus
            crossings per datagram)

     Switching Via a Bus
        i. datagram from input port memory
             to output port memory via a shared bus
        ii. bus contention: switching speed
            limited by bus bandwidth
        iii. 1 Gbps bus, Cisco 1900: sufficient
             speed for access and enterprise
             routers (not regional or backbone)

     Switching Via An Interconnection Network
        i. overcome bus bandwidth limitations
        ii. Banyan networks, other interconnection nets
            initially developed to connect processors in
            multiprocessor
        iii. Advanced design: fragmenting datagram into fixed
            length cells, switch cells through the fabric.
        iv. Cisco 12000: switches Gbps through the
            interconnection network

59. What is flooding?
Ans. Flooding is a simple method to send a packet to all network nodes
        Each node floods a new packet received on an
        incoming link by sending it out all of the other links
        Nodes need to keep track of flooded packets to stop the
        flood; even using a hop limit can blow up exponentially

60. What is Broadcast Routing?
Ans. Broadcast Routing-
    Broadcast sends a packet to all nodes
    • RPF (Reverse Path Forwarding): send broadcast
      received on the link to the source out all remaining links
    • Alternatively, can build and use sink trees at all nodes

61. Write a note on IPv6
Ans. Major upgrade in the 1990s due to impending address
       exhaustion, with various other goals:
        − Support billions of hosts
        − Reduce routing table size
        − Simplify protocol
        − Better security
        − Attention to type of service
        − Aid multicasting
        − Roaming host without changing address
        − Allow future protocol evolution
        − Permit coexistence of old, new protocols, …
    Deployment has been slow & painful, but may pick up
    pace now that addresses are all but exhausted
    IPv6 protocol header has much longer addresses (128
    vs. 32 bits) and is simpler (by using extension headers)

62. What are Internet Control Protocols?
Ans. IP works with the help of several control protocols:
    • ICMP is a companion to IP that returns error info
        − Required, and used in many ways, e.g., for traceroute
    • ARP finds Ethernet address of a local IP address
        − Glue that is needed to send any IP packets
        − Host queries an address and the owner replies
    • DHCP assigns a local IP address to a host
        − Gets host started by automatically configuring it
        − Host sends request to server, which grants a lease


63. Functions of a network layer
Ans.  It translates logical network address into physical address. Concerned with circuit, message or packet switching.
      Routers and gateways operate in the network layer. Mechanism is provided by Network Layer for routing the packets to
      final destination.
      Connection services are provided including network layer flow control, network layer error control and packet
      sequence control.
      Breaks larger packets into small packets.

Ans.  Unicast (destined to one host)
      Multicast (destined to group)
      Broadcast (destined to all)
      Anycast (destined to nearest one)
