8.What is Packet Switching?
   Shortcomings of message switching gave birth to an idea of packet switching. 
   The entire message is broken down into smaller chunks called packets. The switching 
   information is added in the header of each packet and transmitted independently.

   It is easier for intermediate networking devices to store small size packets and they 
   do not take much resources either on carrier path or in the internal memory of switches.
   
   Packet switching enhances line efficiency as packets from multiple applications can be 
   multiplexed over the carrier. The internet uses packet switching technique. 
   Packet switching enables the user to differentiate data streams based on priorities. 
   Packets are stored and forwarded according to their priority to provide quality of service.
   
 9.What is Multiplexing?
   Multiplexing is a technique by which different analog and digital streams of transmission 
   can be simultaneously processed over a shared link. Multiplexing divides the high capacity 
   medium into low capacity logical medium which is then shared by different streams.

   Communication is possible over the air (radio frequency), using a physical media (cable), 
   and light (optical fiber). All mediums are capable of multiplexing.

   When multiple senders try to send over a single medium, a device called Multiplexer 
   divides the physical channel and allocates one to each. On the other end of communication, 
   a De-multiplexer receives data from a single medium, identifies each, and sends to different receivers.
   
10.What is Frequency Division Multiplexing?
   When the carrier is frequency, FDM is used. FDM is an analog technology. FDM divides the spectrum or 
   carrier bandwidth in logical channels and allocates one user to each channel. Each user can use the 
   channel frequency independently and has exclusive access of it. All channels are divided in such a way 
   that they do not overlap with each other. Channels are separated by guard bands. Guard band is a frequency 
   which is not used by either channel.
   
11.What is Time Division Multiplexing?
   TDM is applied primarily on digital signals but can be applied on analog signals as well.   
   In TDM the shared channel is divided among its user by means of time slot. Each user can transmit 
   data within the provided time slot only. Digital signals are divided in frames, equivalent to time slot i.e. 
   frame of an optimal size which can be transmitted in given time slot.

   TDM works in synchronized mode. Both ends, i.e. Multiplexer and De-multiplexer are timely 
   synchronized and both switch to next channel simultaneously.
   When channel A transmits its frame at one end,the De-multiplexer provides media to channel A on the other end.
   As soon as the channel Aâ€™s time slot expires, this side switches to channel B. On the other end, 
   the De-multiplexer works in a synchronized manner and provides media to channel B. 
   Signals from different channels travel the path in interleaved manner.
   
12.What is Wavelength Division Multiplexing?
   Light has different wavelength (colors). In fiber optic mode, multiple optical carrier signals are multiplexed 
   into an optical fiber by using different wavelengths. 
   This is an analog multiplexing technique and is done conceptually in the same manner as FDM but uses light as signals.
   Further, on each wavelength time division multiplexing can be incorporated to accommodate more data signals.

13.What is Code Division Multiplexing?
   Multiple data signals can be transmitted over a single frequency by using Code Division Multiplexing. 
   FDM divides the frequency in smaller channels but CDM allows its users to full bandwidth and transmit 
   signals all the time using a unique code. CDM uses orthogonal codes to spread signals.

   Each station is assigned with a unique code, called chip. Signals travel with these codes independently, 
   inside the whole bandwidth.The receiver knows in advance the chip code signal it has to receive.

48. Name type of signals and explain them.

Ans. Signals 
	When data is sent over physical medium, it needs to be first converted into
	electromagnetic signals. Data itself can be analog such as human voice, or digital
	such as file on the disk. Both analog and digital data can be represented in digital or
	analog signals.
	        i.Digital Signals
		 Digital signals are discrete in nature and represent sequence of voltage pulses. Digital
		 signals are used within the circuitry of a computer system.
		ii.Analog Signals
		 Analog signals are in continuous wave form in nature and represented by continuous
		 electromagnetic waves.

49. What is Transmission Impairment? Explain the reasons responsible for it.
Ans. When signals travel through the medium, they tend to deteriorate. This may have
     many reasons as given:
	
	i.Attenuation
	For the receiver to interpret the data accurately, the signal must be sufficiently
	strong. When the signal passes through the medium, it tends to get weaker. As it
	covers distance, it loses strength.

	ii.Dispersion
	As signal travels through the media, it tends to spread and overlaps. The amount of
	dispersion depends upon the frequency used.

	iii.Delay distortion
	Signals are sent over media with pre-defined speed and frequency. If the signal speed
	and frequency do not match, there are possibilities that signal reaches destination in 
	arbitrary fashion. In digital media, this is very critical that some bits reach earlier
	than the previously sent ones.


	iv.Noise
	Random disturbance or fluctuation in analog or digital signal is said to be Noise in
	signal, which may distort the actual information being carried. Noise can be
	characterized in one of the following class:

	v.Thermal Noise
	Heat agitates the electronic conductors of a medium which may introduce noise in
	the media. Up to a certain level, thermal noise is unavoidable.

	vi.Intermodulation
	When multiple frequencies share a medium, their interference can cause noise in the
	medium. Intermodulation noise occurs if two different frequencies are sharing a
	medium and one of them has excessive strength or the component itself is not
	functioning properly, then the resultant frequency may not be delivered as expected.

	vii.Crosstalk
	This sort of noise happens when a foreign signal enters into the media. This is because
	signal in one medium affects the signal of second medium.

	ix.Impulse
	This noise is introduced because of irregular disturbances such as lightening,
	electricity, short-circuit, or faulty components. Digital data is mostly affected by this
	sort of noise.

50.Explain Transmission media and its types.
Ans. Transmission Media
	The media over which the information between two computer systems is sent, called
	transmission media. Transmission media comes in two forms.
	
	i.Guided Media
	All communication wires/cables are guided media, such as UTP, coaxial cables, and
	fiber Optics. In this media, the sender and receiver are directly connected and the
	information is send (guided) through it.

	ii.Unguided Media
	Wireless or open air space is said to be unguided media, because there is no
	connectivity between the sender and receiver. Information is spread over the air, and
	anyone including the actual recipient may collect the information.

51.What is Channel Capacity?
Ans. The speed of transmission of information is said to be the channel capacity. We count
	it as data rate in digital world. It depends on numerous factors such as:
	
	i.Bandwidth: The physical limitation of underlying media.
	ii. Error-rate: Incorrect reception of information because of noise.
	iii. Encoding: The number of levels used for signaling.

   4.Size - In comparison to copper, a fibre optic cable has nearly 4.5 times as much capacity as the wire cable has
            and a cross sectional area that is 30 times less.
   5. Weight - Fibre optic cables are much thinner and lighter than metal wires.
   6.Safety - Since the fibre is a dielectric, it does not present a spark hazard. 

   7. Security - Optical fibres are difficult to tap
   8.Flexibility - An optical fibre has greater tensile strength than copper or steel fibres of the same diameter. 
                   It is flexible, bends easily and resists most corrosive elements that attack copper cable.

73. What is switching and categories of Switching?
  Switching is process to forward packets coming in from one port to a port leading towards the destination. 
  When data comes on a port it is called ingress, and when data leaves a port or goes out it is called egress.
  A communication system may include number of switches and nodes. At broad level, 
  switching can be divided into two major categories:

  1.Connectionless: The data is forwarded on behalf of forwarding tables. No previous handshaking is required 
    and acknowledgements are optional.

  2.Connection Oriented:  Before switching data to be forwarded to destination, there is a need to pre-establish 
    circuit along the path between both endpoints. Data is then forwarded on that circuit. After the transfer is 
    completed, circuits can be kept for future use or can be turned down immediately.

74.What are the types of switching?
   1.Circuit Switching
   2.Message Switching
   3.Packet Switching
   
75. What is Circuit Switching?
   When two nodes communicate with each other over a dedicated communication path, it is called circuit 
   switching.There 'is a need of pre-specified route from which data will travels and no other data is 
   permitted.In circuit switching, to transfer the data, circuit must be established so that the data transfer can take place.
   Circuits can be permanent or temporary. Applications which use circuit switching may have to go through three phases:

   1.Establish a circuit
   2.Transfer the data
   3.Disconnect the circuit
   
   Circuit switching was designed for voice applications. Telephone is the best suitable example of 
   circuit switching. Before a user can make a call, a virtual path between caller and callee is established over the network.
   
76. What is Message Switching?
   This technique was somewhere in middle of circuit switching and packet switching. In message 
   switching, the whole message is treated as a data unit and is switching / transferred in its entirety.
   A switch working on message switching, first receives the whole message and buffers it until there are 
   resources available to transfer it to the next hop. If the next hop is not having enough resource to 
   accommodate large size message, the message is stored and switch waits.
   
   This technique was considered substitute to circuit switching. As in circuit switching the whole path 
   is blocked for two entities only. Message switching is replaced by packet switching. 
   Message switching has the following drawbacks:

   1.Every switch in transit path needs enough storage to accommodate entire message.
   2.Because of store-and-forward technique and waits included until resources are available, 
     message switching is very slow.
   3.Message switching was not a solution for streaming media and real-time applications.
