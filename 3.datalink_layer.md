
### 1. What is data link layer?
Data Link Layer is second layer of OSI Layered Model. Data link layer is responsible for converting data stream to signals bit by bit and to send that over the underlying hardware.
The Data Link layer is concerned with moving data across the physical links in the network.

### 2. What are the functions of data link layer

1.framing
  Data-link layer takes packets from Network Layer and encapsulates them into Frames.Then,
  it sends each frame bit-by-bit on the hardware. At receiver’ end, data link layer picks
  up signals from hardware and assembles them into frames.
2.addressing
  Data-link layer provides layer-2 hardware addressing mechanism. Hardware address is assumed
  to be unique on the link. It is encoded into hardware at the time of manufacturing.
3.synchronization
  When data frames are sent on the link, both machines must be synchronized in order to
  transfer to take place.
4.error control
  Sometimes signals may have encountered problem in transition and the bits are flipped.
  These errors are detected and attempted to recover actual data bits. It also provides error reporting
  mechanism to the sender.
5.flow control
  Stations on same link may have different speed or capacity. Data-link layer ensures flow control
  that enables both machine to exchange data on same speed
6.multi-access
  Stations on same link may have different speed or capacity. Data-link layer ensures flow control
  that enables both machine to exchange data on same speed

### 3.Tyes of errors

Single bit error:In a frame, there is only one bit, anywhere though, which is corrupt.
Multiple bits error:Frame is received with more than one bits in corrupted state.
Burst error:Frame contains more than 1 consecutive bits corrupted.


### 4.What are the error control mechanism?

   1.error detection
   2.error correction


  1.error detection
  Errors in the received frames are detected by means of Parity Check and Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC).
  In both cases, few extra bits are sent along with actual data to confirm that bits received at other
  end are same as they were sent. If the counter-check at receiver’ end fails, the bits are considered corrupted.

  Parity Check
  a.One extra bit is sent along with the original bits to make number of 1s either even in case of even parity,
  or odd in case of odd parity.

  b.The sender while creating a frame counts the number of 1s in it. For example, if even parity is used
  and number of 1s is even then one bit with value 0 is added. This way number of 1s remains even.If the
  number of 1s is odd, to make it even a bit with value 1 is added.

  c.The receiver simply counts the number of 1s in a frame. If the count of 1s is even and even parity is used,
  the frame is considered to be not-corrupted and is accepted. If the count of 1s is odd and odd parity is used,
  the frame is still not corrupted.

  d.If a single bit flips in transit, the receiver can detect it by counting the number of 1s.
  But when more than one bits are erro neous, then it is very hard for the receiver to detect the error.

  2.Error correction
   In the digital world, error correction can be done in two ways:

   A.Backward Error Correction  :When the receiver detects an error in the data received,
   it requests back the sender to retransmit the data unit.
   B.Forward Error Correction  :When the receiver detects some error in the data received,
   it executes error-correcting code, which helps it to auto-recover and to correct some kinds of errors.

### 5.Flow Control
  When a data frame (Layer-2 data) is sent from one host to another over a single medium, it is required
  that the sender and receiver should work at the same speed. That is, sender sends at a speed on which
  the receiver can process and accept the data.
  If sender is sending too fast the receiver may be overloaded, (swamped) and data may be lost.

  Two types of mechanisms can be deployed to control the flow:
  1.Stop and Wait
    This flow control mechanism ### forces the sender after transmitting a data frame to stop and wait until
    the acknowledgement of the data-frame sent is received.
  2.Sliding Window
    In this flow control mechanism, both sender and receiver agree on the number of data-frames after which
    the acknowledgement should be sent. As we learnt, stop and wait flow control mechanism wastes resources,
    this protocol tries to make use of underlying resources as much as possible.

### 6.Error Control
  When data-frame is transmitted, there is a probability that data-frame may be lost in the transit or
  it is received corrupted. In both cases, the receiver does not receive the correct data-frame and sender
  does not know anything about any loss.In such case, both sender and receiver are equipped with some
  protocols which helps them to detect transit errors such as loss of data-frame. Hence, either the sender
  retransmits the data-frame or the receiver may request to resend the previous data-frame.

  Requirements for error control mechanism:
  1.Error detection  - The sender and receiver, either both or any, must ascertain that there is some error in the transit.
  2.Positive ACK  - When the receiver receives a correct frame, it should acknowledge it.
  3.Negative ACK  - When the receiver receives a damaged frame or a duplicate frame, it sends a NACK back to the sender and the
    sender must retransmit the correct frame.
  4.Retransmission:  The sender maintains a clock and sets a timeout period. If an acknowledgement of a data-frame previously
    transmitted does not arrive before the timeout the sender retransmits the frame, thinking that the frame or it’s acknowledgement
    is lost in transit.

  There are three types of techniques available which Data-link layer may deploy to control the errors by
  Automatic Repeat Requests (ARQ):
  Stop-and-wait ARQ
  The following transition may occur in Stop-and-Wait ARQ:
  1.The sender maintains a timeout counter.
  2.When a frame is sent, the sender starts the timeout counter.
  3.If acknowledgement of frame comes in time, the sender transmits the next frame in queue.
  4.If acknowledgement does not come in time, the sender assumes that either the frame or its acknowledgement
  is lost in transit. Sender retransmits the frame and starts the timeout counter.
  5.If a negative acknowledgement is received, the sender retransmits the frame.

  Go-Back-N ARQ
  Stop and wait ARQ mechanism does not utilize the resources at their best.When the acknowledgement is received,
  the sender sits idle and does nothing. In Go-Back-N ARQ method, both sender and receiver maintain a window.
  The sending-window size enables the sender to send multiple frames without receiving the acknowledgement of the previous ones.
  The receiving-window enables the receiver to receive multiple frames and acknowledge them. The receiver keeps track of incoming
  frame’s sequence number.

  When the sender sends all the frames in window, it checks up to what sequence number it has received positive
  acknowledgement. If all frames are positively acknowledged, the sender sends next set of frames.
  If sender finds that it has received NACK or has not receive any ACK for a particular frame, it retransmits all the
  frames after which it does not receive any positive ACK.

  Selective Repeat ARQ
  In Go-back-N ARQ, it is assumed that the receiver does not have any buffer space for its window size
  and has to process each frame as it comes. This enforces the sender to retransmit all the frames which are not acknowledged.
  In Selective-Repeat ARQ, the receiver while keeping track of sequence numbers, buffers the frames in memory and sends NACK
  for only frame which is missing or damaged.
  The sender in this case, sends only packet for which NACK is received.

### 10. What is Flow Control?
   Flow control is the management of data flow between computers or devices or between nodes in a network so that the data can be handled at an efficient pace. Too much data arriving before a device can handle it causes data overflow, meaning the data is either lost or must be retransmitted.

### 11.What is one of the functions of the data link layer?
The three main functions of the data link layer are to deal with transmission errors,
regulate the flow of data, and provide a well-defined interface to the network layer.


### 12. Which sublayer of the data link layer performs data link functions that depend upon the type of medium?
 medium access control sublayer

### 13. The data link layer takes the packets from _____ and encapsulates them into frames for transmission.
   network layer


### 14. What is Framing?

The usual approach for the data link layer is to break up the bit stream into
discrete frames, compute a short token called a checksum for each frame, and include
the checksum in the frame when it is transmitted. When a frame arrives at the destination,
the checksum is recomputed. If the newly computed checksum is different from
the one contained in the frame, the data link layer knows that an error has occurred
and takes steps to deal with it (e.g., discarding the bad frame and possibly
also sending back an error report).

This is known as framing.Which sublayer of the data link layer performs data link functions that depend upon the type of medium?
media access control sublayer

### 18 .What is framing in the data link layer?
A point-to-point connection between two computers or devices consists of a wire in which data is transmitted as a stream of bits. However, these bits must be framed into discernible blocks of information. Framing is a function of the data link layer. It provides a way for a sender to transmit a set of bits that are meaningful to the receiver. Ethernet, token ring, frame relay, and other data link layer technologies have their own frame structures. Frames have headers that contain information such as error-checking codes.
Types:
Character  Count

Flag bytes with byte stuffing

Flag bytes with bit stuffing

### 28. Explain sliding window

Sliding window refers to an imaginary boxes that hold the frames on both sender and receiver side.
• It provides the upper limit on the number of frames that can be transmitted before requiring an acknowledgment.
• Frames may be acknowledged by receiver at any point even when window is not full on receiver side.
• Frames may be transmitted by source even when window is not yet full on sender side.
• The windows have a specific size in which the frames are numbered modulo- n, which means they are numbered from 0 to n-l.
For e.g. if n = 8, the frames are numbered 0, 1,2,3,4,5,6, 7, 0, 1,2,3,4,5,6, 7, 0, 1, ....
• The size of window is n-1. For e.g. In this case it is 7. Therefore, a maximum of n-l frames may be sent before an acknowledgment.
• When the receiver sends an ACK, it includes the number of next frame it expects to receive. For example in order to acknowledge the
group of frames ending in frame 4, the receiver sends an ACK containing the number 5. When sender sees an ACK with number 5, it comes
to know that all the frames up to number 4 have been received.


### 29. write a short note on Framing?
ans:A frame is a digital data transmission unit in computer networking and telecommunication. A frame typically includes frame synchronization features consisting of a sequence of bits or symbols that indicate to the receiver the beginning and end of the payload data within the stream of symbols or bits it receives. If a receiver is connected to the system in the middle of a frame transmission, it ignores the data until it detects a new frame synchronization sequence.

In the OSI model of computer networking, a frame is the protocol data unit at the data link layer. Frames are the result of the final layer of encapsulation before the data is transmitted over the physical layer.[1] A frame is "the unit of transmission in a link layer protocol, and consists of a link layer header followed by a packet."[2] Each frame is separated from the next by an interframe gap. A frame is a series of bits generally composed of framing bits, the packet payload, and a frame check sequence. Examples are Ethernet frames, Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) frames, Fibre Channel frames, and V.42 modem frames.

In telecommunications, specifically in time-division multiplex (TDM) and time-division multiple access (TDMA) variants, a frame is a cyclically repeated data block that consists of a fixed number of time slots, one for each logical TDM channel or TDMA transmitter. In this context, a frame is typically an entity at the physical layer. TDM application examples are SONET/SDH and the ISDN circuit switched B-channel, while TDMA examples are the 2G and 3G circuit-switched cellular voice services. The frame is also an entity for time-division duplex, where the mobile terminal may transmit during some timeslots and receive during others.

Often, frames of several different sizes are nested inside each other. For example, when using Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) over asynchronous serial communication, the eight bits of each individual byte are framed by start and stop bits,[3][4] the payload data bytes in a network packet are framed by the header and footer, and several packets can be framed with frame boundary octets.[5]
